# Read
Learn about UML diagrams and how to read them [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-class-diagram?a=1).
They are high-level representations of how a software or system is structured. They can be easily edited to make large changes
to the structure of a system.

# Edit
To edit the UML diagram, use StarUML.
Available for free [here](staruml.io), compatible with Mac and Windows.
It will ask you if you'd like to purchase a license, but you can use the 'evaluation' version indefinitley, similar to WinRAR.
Not sure if this file can be edited with other UML editing tools.
